/**
 * A 32-bit generator that needs no math on 64-bit values to calculate high-quality pseudo-random numbers, and has been
 * adapted to meet the needs of GWT while maintaining compatibility with other JDK platforms. It is a combination of a
 * Marsaglia-style XorShift generator with an "XLCG" generator (like a linear congruential generator but using XOR
 * instead of addition). It has 2 ints for state, stateA and stateB, where stateA is modified by the XorShift and cannot
 * be given 0, and stateB is modified by the XLCG and can be assigned any int. stateA will never be 0, but will be
 * every other int with equal frequency; it repeats every {@code Math.pow(2, 32) - 1} generated numbers. stateB goes
 * through every int by assigning the XLCG result calculated with stateB to stateB; that is then used as input to a
 * XorShift algorithm (with different constants) and the result added to stateA to get the output of one int. The total
 * period is 0xFFFFFFFF00000000 (18446744069414584320). Quality is very good here, and this passes PractRand without
 * failures and with 3 minor (classified as "unusual" and all different kinds) anomalies on 32TB of testing; this is
 * probably enough to confirm a generator as high-quality. It's still possible that tests not present in PractRand can
 * detect errors in Zag32RNG.
 * <br>
 * Although Zag32RNG has a {@link #determine(int, int)} method, calling it is considerably more complex than other
 * RandomnessSources that provide determine() methods. It also doesn't allow skipping through the state, and a moderate
 * amount of the possible values that can be provided with {@link #setState(long)} will be changed before this can use
 * them (there are fewer than 2 to the 64 possible states, but only somewhat).
