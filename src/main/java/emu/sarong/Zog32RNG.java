/**
 * A 32-bit generator that needs no math on 64-bit values to calculate high-quality pseudo-random numbers, and has been
 * adapted to meet the needs of GWT while maintaining compatibility with other JDK platforms. It won't ever multiply an
 * int by a number with more than 20 bits, and along with bitwise operations used frequently, this prevents precision
 * loss on GWT from when an int fails to overflow and exceeds 2 to the 53. The only other generators in this library
 * that avoids GWT precision loss like that are {@link Zig32RNG}, which this is based on, {@link Zag32RNG},
 * {@link XoRo32RNG}, and {@link ThrustAlt32RNG}, but XoRo32RNG fails some statistical quality tests and ThrustAlt32RNG
 * isn't capable of producing all int results and has a small bias toward other results. All generators that perform
 * their internal operations with long values, such as {@link LightRNG}, aren't affected by the lack of overflow on ints
 * with GWT. {@link LongPeriodRNG} and {@link MersenneTwister} use an int counter with long values for state, but they
 * manually wrap the counter long before overflow would occur. However, all the math on longs has a hefty performance
 * penalty on GWT, even for normally very fast generators like LightRNG, while Zog32RNG is able to safely use ints with
 * much higher performance.
 * <br>
 * Zog32RNG has extremely good speed on GWT, though how good depends on the browser being used and whether 32-bit or
 * 64-bit results are needed. It's hard to tell if Zog32RNG has any difference in performance on GWT relative to
 * {@link Zag32RNG}, which is very similar. Relative to {@link XoRo32RNG}, this is not especially fast, but this
 * generator does pass all of PractRand's statistical quality tests while XoRo32RNG does not out-of-the-box. The results
 * for Zag32RNG are repeated here; Zog32RNG should be extremely close: "In Opera 51 on a Windows 7 laptop (64-bit), it
 * takes roughly 43 microseconds to generate 10,000 int values with Zag32RNG; ThrustAlt32RNG takes roughly 37
 * microseconds, and LightRNG takes roughly 1929 microseconds. To generate 10,000 long values with Zag32RNG, it takes
 * roughly 891 microseconds; ThrustAlt32RNG takes 1368 microseconds (an odd slowdown for a normally-faster generator),
 * and LightRNG takes roughly 2480 microseconds." Zog32RNG is about the same speed as Zag32RNG on GWT, but Zog32RNG is a
 * fair amount faster than it on a desktop JRE. The total period of Zog32RNG is 0xFFFFFFFF00000000
 * (18446744069414584320). Quality is excellent here, and this passes PractRand without failures and with 1 minor
 * anomaly (classified as "unusual") on the full 32TB of testing. This is the best result so far for a
 * correctly-distributed 32-bit generator.
 * <br>
 * For the specific structure of Zog32RNG, it is a combination of a Marsaglia-style XorShift generator with a
 * SplitMix-like generator (adding a large odd number and only changing a copy of the state with xorshifts and one
 * multiplication by a small-ish constant). It has 2 ints for state, stateA and stateB, where stateA is modified by the
 * XorShift and cannot be given 0, and stateB is modified by the additive part of the SplitMix update and can be
 * assigned any int. stateA will never be 0, but will be every non-0 int with equal frequency; it repeats every
 * {@code Math.pow(2, 32) - 1} generated numbers. stateB goes through every int over the course of the SplitMix-like's
 * period; itnaturally has a period of {@code Math.pow(2, 32)}. Only some of the operations done in SplitMix normally
 * are actually needeed in this case to ensure quality; because the XorShift is added to the SplitMix at the last stage,
 * patterns tend to be harder to detect than if SplitMix or XorShift were used on their own, and one of the two steps
 * in SplitMix where the state is xorshifted right and multiplied can be omitted without quality loss. The XorShift that
 * stateA uses is a normal kind that involves two rightward shifts and one leftward shift, and the SplitMix that stateB
 * uses only involves one multiplication instead of the normal two, as well as one less xor and one less rightward
 * shift. This generator is not reversible given the output of {@link #nextInt()}, though the update steps for stateA
 * and stateB are both individually reversible.
 * <br>
 * Although Zog32RNG has a {@link #determine(int, int)} method, calling it is considerably more complex than other
 * RandomnessSources that provide determine() methods. It also doesn't allow skipping through the state, and a moderate
 * amount of the possible values that can be provided with {@link #setState(long)} will be changed before this can use
 * them (there are fewer than 2 to the 64 possible states, but only somewhat).
