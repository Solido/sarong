/**
 * An IRNG implementation that is meant to provide random numbers very quickly when targeting GWT but also to produce
 * the same numbers when used on desktop, Android, or other platforms, and that can have its state read as a
 * StatefulRandomness. This uses the same algorithm as {@link Lathe32RNG}, which means it has two 32-bit ints for state
 * and a period of 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (2 to the 64 minus 1), while passing 32TB of PractRand tests (so its quality is
 * very good). Unlike {@link RNG}, there is no RandomnessSource that can be swapped out, but also somewhat less
 * indirection on common calls like {@link #nextInt()} and {@link #nextFloat()}. Although this implements
 * {@link StatefulRandomness}, it is not recommended to use this as the RandomnessSource for a StatefulRNG; you should
 * use {@link Lathe32RNG} if you want the larger API provided by StatefulRNG and/or RNG while keeping similar, though
 * probably slightly weaker, GWT performance relative to this class.
