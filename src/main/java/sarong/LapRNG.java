/**
 * Like FlapRNG, this sacrifices quality for speed, but it uses 64-bit math and as such has a larger period (FlapRNG
 * will repeat the cycle of random numbers it produces after about 8 billion numbers, while this will only repeat after
 * many more, probably 2 to the 65). As such, LapRNG is like FlapRNG but can generate for a longer period of time (more
 * laps) without repeating, and in some cases (mainly generating 64-bit values) at even higher speed. It is currently
 * the fastest RandomnessSource in this library at generating 64-bit longs, which is most of what {@link RNG} uses, and
 * is second-fastest at generating 32-bit ints, with FlapRNG just slightly faster at that. While the period must be at
 * least 2 to the 64, it is likely that it is actually 2 to the 65.

 * Created by Tommy Ettinger on 5/25/2017.
 * @see FlapRNG FlapRNG is similar in goal to LapRNG but is implemented using int math, ideal for GWT or 32-bit OSes
 * @see ZapRNG ZapRNG is based on LapRNG, and is somewhat slower but has better quality with the same period
