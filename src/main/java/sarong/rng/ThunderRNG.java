 * Like LightRNG, but shares a lot in common with CrossHash's hashing mechanism. The name comes from its
 * similarity to the nickname for that hash, Lightning, but also to how it acts like LightRNG except with a
 * thunder-like "echo" where the state affects the result in two places, in different ways.
 * <br>
 * It appears to be the fastest RandomnessSource we have available, but there's no way to be certain of its
 * exact period or potential flaws until a more thorough test, like TestU01, can be run on it.
