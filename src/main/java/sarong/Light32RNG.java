/**
 * Based on the same SplitMix algorithm {@link LightRNG} uses, but a 32-bit variant, this RandomnessSource has 63 bits
 * of state and should have a period of 2 to the 63. It has 2 ints for state, one of which changes with every number
 * generated (state A), and the other of which changes rarely and is always odd (state B). State A goes through every
 * number in a simple sequence that would normally repeat after 2 to the 32 generations, and always will be 0 once every
 * 2 to the 32 generations; the sequence is formed by just adding state B to state A. When state A changes to 0, state B
 * changes by adding a large even constant and that is used for the rest of the next 2 to the 32 generations. Although
 * this uses a ternary conditional to determine when to change state B, the branch on which state B changes happens so
 * rarely that processor branch prediction can almost optimize it out, and this is just slightly slower than LightRNG on
 * 32-bit int generation. Quality is not great with such a small state; this shouldn't be expected to pass many tests on
 * 2GB or more of tested data.
