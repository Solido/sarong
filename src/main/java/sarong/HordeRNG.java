/**
 * A mix of something like the fast algorithm of LapRNG with the larger state size of LongPeriodRNG, in the hopes of
 * improving Lap's period without seriously reducing speed. It sorta works, since {@link #nextLong()} is faster than
 * {@link LongPeriodRNG#nextLong()} by a fair amount, but only "sorta" because methods like {@link #next(int)} slow
 * down when they are called by classes like RNG, though not as severely as with the related {@link HerdRNG}. There's
 * some behavior of the JVM at play here, and it may be different across machines and installations. This has 1024 bits
 * of {@link #state} in an long array with 16 elements, plus 32 bits of semi-state in the {@link #choice} field (used to
 * decide which of the 16 longs in state to update and query). The period is known to be fairly good, and must be at
 * least (2 to the 80) but is almost certainly much higher, since testing a variant of this with significantly fewer
 * bits of state (using 4 shorts instead of 16 longs, with the same int for choice) still had a period greater than 2 to
 * the 38, implying the period here may be greater than (2 to the 512), and potentially as high as (2 to the 1024),
 * though this last possibility is very unlikely.
