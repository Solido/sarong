/**
 * A variant on LapRNG that improves the quality at the expense of some speed. Running ZapRNG through PractRand, a tool
 * for evaluating the statistical quality of PRNGs, found far, far fewer statistical failures than LapRNG, and also had
 * them generally be less severe. The period is still relatively low, at (with a high degree of certainty) 2 to the 65,
 * but the speed is still fairly good; slightly faster than ThunderRNG (an earlier version was within 1% difference, but
 * subsequent changes sped up Zap by about 5-10%), faster than LightRNG all around, slower than LapRNG for all methods,
 * and slower than FlapRNG on next() and nextInt() but not on nextLong(). Like LapRNG, there should be many possible
 * sequences of length (2 to the 65) this can produce, depending on the relationship between the two longs used for
 * state, determined at construction or when the seed is set.
