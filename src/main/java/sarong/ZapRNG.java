/**
 * A variant on LapRNG that improves the quality at the expense of some speed. Running ZapRNG through PractRand, a tool
 * for evaluating the statistical quality of PRNGs, found far, far fewer statistical failures than LapRNG, and also had
 * them generally be less severe. The period is still relatively low, at (with a high degree of certainty) 2 to the 65,
 * but the speed is still fairly good; approximately the same as or slightly faster than ThunderRNG (generally within
 * 1% difference, and definitely within the margin of error), faster than LightRNG all around, slower than LapRNG for
 * all methods, and slower than FlapRNG on next() and nextInt() but not on nextLong(). Like LapRNG, there should be many
 * possible sequences of length (2 to the 65) this can produce, depending on the relationship between the two longs used
 * for state, determined at construction or when the seed is set.
