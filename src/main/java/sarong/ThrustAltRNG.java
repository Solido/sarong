/**
 * A variant on {@link ThrustRNG} that gives up a small amount of speed to attain better quality. ThrustAltRNG is
 * expected to pass BigCrush, which is a difficult statistical quality test that is part of TestU01, because it does so
 * well on other statistical tests. On <a href="http://gjrand.sourceforge.net/">gjrand</a>'s "testunif" checks, this
 * does very well on 100GB of tested data, with the "Overall summary one sided P-value P = 0.981", where 1 is perfect
 * and 0.1 or less is a failure. On <a href="http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/">PractRand</a>, this runs past 8TB of
 * generated numbers without finding any failures, and this version avoids issues with Gap-16 tests that cause ThrustRNG
 * to fail at 32GB and can cause slight variations on the code here to fail at 256GB. Like ThrustRNG and LightRNG, this
 * changes its state with a steady fixed increment, and does cipher-like adjustments to the current state to randomize
 * it. The period on ThrustAltRNG is 2 to the 64. ThrustAltRNG is a bit slower than ThrustRNG (but seems to have better
 * quality), while it is faster than LightRNG, XoRoRNG, and most other very-high-quality generators (not counting
 * ThrustRNG). Similarly to other cipher-like PRNGs, ThrustAltRNG has a {@link #determine(long)} method that takes a
 * state as a long and returns a deterministic random number (each input has one output). Unlike some generators (like
 * PermutedRNG), changing the seed even slightly generally produces completely different results, which applies
 * primarily to determine() but also the first number generated in a series of nextLong() calls.
 * <br>
 * As an aside, this generator has probably been adjusted more by me than any other generator in the library, and if
 * quality is only somewhat more important than speed, this should be ideal, though it isn't the fastest and doesn't
 * have the highest quality. For some purposes, ThrustRNG will be better because it is faster. For others, XoRoRNG or
 * IsaacRNG may be better because they may have more-provably-good quality. Note than XoRoRNG fails binary rank tests,
 * which may be important for some usage, while LightRNG and ThrustAltRNG don't. ThrustAltRNG actually does better than
 * LightRNG on gjrand's tests despite LightRNG using significantly more operations (LightRNG has "P = 0.305" on gjrand
 * with 100GB tested and fails 2 of 13 tests with grade 1 failures, while ThrustAltRNG fails none). IsaacRNG is also
 * substantially slower than most other generators, though it offers better promise of security.
 * <br>
 * This generator has changed since its introduction; the initial version used both the current and subsequent states
 * during each calculation, while this version only uses the current state (which it updates as it reads it). This makes
 * the {@link #skip(long)} method much simpler and (because it requires less operations in general) probably faster as
 * well, while it seems to have no performance impact on the normal {@link #nextLong()} and {@link #next(int)} methods.
 * Quality is very high, actually better than the first version according to gjrand (the earlier one had a P-value of
 * 0.904, while this has 0.981), but this goes even further on PractRand tests than the previous one (passing 8TB after
 * over a day of testing), while the earlier version was showing signs of imminent failure around 2TB. This generator
 * is closely related to {@link Jab63RNG}, and findings for that generator proved applicable during development.
