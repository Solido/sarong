/**
 * A variant on {@link ThrustRNG} that gives up a small amount of speed to attain better quality. ThrustAltRNG is
 * expected to pass BigCrush, which is a difficult statistical quality test that is part of TestU01, because it does so
 * well on other statistical tests. On <a href="http://gjrand.sourceforge.net/">gjrand</a>'s "testunif" checks, this
 * does very well on 100GB of tested data, with the "Overall summary one sided P-value P = 0.904", where 1 is perfect
 * and 0.1 or less is a failure. On <a href="http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/">PractRand</a>, this runs past 1TB of
 * generated numbers without finding any failures, and this version avoids issues with Gap-16 tests that cause ThrustRNG
 * to fail at 32GB and can cause slight variations on the code here to fail at 256GB. Like ThrustRNG and LightRNG, this
 * changes its state with a steady fixed increment, and does cipher-like adjustments to the current state to randomize
 * it. Unlike those two RNGs, ThrustAltRNG uses both the current and subsequent state in its calculations, which appears
 * critical to improve quality given how simple the algorithm is. The period on ThrustAltRNG is 2 to the 64.
 * ThrustAltRNG is a bit slower than ThrustRNG (but seems to have better quality), while it is faster than LightRNG,
 * XoRoRNG, and most other very-high-quality generators (not counting ThrustRNG). Similarly to other cipher-like PRNGs,
 * ThrustAltRNG has a {@link #determine(long)} method that takes a state as a long and returns a deterministic random
 * number (each input has one output). Unlike some generators (like PermutedRNG), changing the seed even slightly
 * generally produces completely different results, which applies primarily to determine() but also the first number
 * generated in a series of nextLong() calls.
 * <br>
 * As an aside, this generator has probably been adjusted more by me than any other generator in the library, and if
 * quality is only somewhat more important than speed, this should be ideal, though it isn't the fastest and doesn't
 * have the highest quality. For some purposes, ThrustRNG will be better because it is faster. For others, XoRoRNG or
 * IsaacRNG may be better because they may have more-provably-good quality. Note than XoRoRNG fails binary rank tests,
 * which may be important for some usage, while LightRNG and ThrustAltRNG don't. ThrustAltRNG actually does better than
 * LightRNG on gjrand's tests despite LightRNG using significantly more operations (LightRNG has "P = 0.305" on gjrand
 * with 100GB tested and fails 2 of 13 tests with grade 1 failures, while ThrustAltRNG fails none). IsaacRNG is also
 * substantially slower than most other generators, though it offers better promise of security.
