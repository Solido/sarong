/**
 * Like PintRNG (uses int math primarily, making it good with GWT and 32-bit machines) and FlapRNG, but with a longer
 * period than either, plus this implements StatefulRandomness. SlapRNG should have higher quality than FlapRNG based on
 * some rough metrics, but its period is known to be longer than FlapRNG's for most seeds, if not all. Precisely how
 * much longer isn't clear yet; this uses an irregular increment that depends on part of the current state, and it seems
 * possible that certain rare seeds have an effect on the length of the period. That said, the period should be at least
 * 2 to the 34 for most seeds, and is probably higher. This generator is not nearly as fast as FlapRNG, but it is
 * comparable to (for ints) or faster than (for longs) PintRNG while having a longer (at least 8x) period, mainly thanks
 * to more bits of state. The mechanism by which this produces pseudo-randomness is somewhat unusual, and involves two
 * state variables as ints, one of which is used both before and after that state part changes. This slows down the
 * generation slightly due to a data dependency between the before and after states (the same speed problem most linear
 * congruential generators face when trying to reach ideal performance), but seems to significantly improve period. It
 * should be noted that when targeting GWT and 32-bit machines, SlapRNG provides one of the best combinations of period,
 * quality, compatibility, and speed that we have, with other generators beating it on some of those but not all of
 * them. FlapRNG is faster by about 2x, but sacrifices quality and period. PintRNG has better quality, is about the same
 * speed and has a lower period. Other generators give up efficient compatibility with GWT due to long math (which is
 * slower and probably produces garbage on GWT), though many are faster on PCs (LapRNG and ThunderRNG, for instance).
 * The {@link #nextLong()} method of this class is, unusually, not much slower than the {@link #nextInt()} method (about
 * 10% slower or less), unlike the nextLong() methods on PintRNG and FlapRNG, which take about twice as much time to
 * produce a long.
