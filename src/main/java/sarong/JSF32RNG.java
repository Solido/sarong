/**
 * A high-quality 32-bit generator using one of
 * <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bob-jenkins-small-prng-passes-practrand.html">Bob Jenkins' designs</a>; JSF
 * is short for Jenkins Small Fast and was coined by Chris Doty-Humphrey when he reviewed it favorably in PractRand.
 * This is a "chaotic" generator, meaning its state transition is very challenging to predict; it is essentially
 * impossible to invert the generator and get the state from even quite a lot of outputs, unlike generators like
 * {@link LightRNG}. It uses no multiplication internally and primarily depends on bitwise rotation combined with fast
 * operations like addition and XOR to achieve quality results. Its period is unknown beyond that for all seeds
 * possible, the period must be at minimum 2 to the 20, and is at most a little less than 2 to the 128.
 * <br>
 * This is a RandomnessSource but not a StatefulRandomness because it needs to take care and avoid seeds that would put
 * it in a short-period subcycle. It always takes an int when being seeded.
 * <br>
 * Special thanks to everyone who's reviewed this type of RNG, especially M.E. O'Neill, whose blog showed me how useful
 * JSF is. Of course, thanks go to Bob Jenkins for writing yet another remarkable piece of code.
