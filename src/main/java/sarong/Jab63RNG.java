/**
 * A very fast and high-quality generator, but one that is not equidistributed because it produces 64-bit longs from 63
 * bits of state (meaning half of all possible long values cannot be returned by this generator). This still passes
 * gjrand with no failures on 100 GB of test data, and PractRand with 4 TB (!), while keeping speed in line with
 * ThrustRNG. ThrustRNG fails PractRand at 32GB, so this version seems to be a substantial improvement in some ways. The
 * state is always odd here, and {@link #setState(long)} will always ensure that is maintained.
