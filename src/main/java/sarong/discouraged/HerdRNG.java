/**
 * A mix of fast 32-bit-friendly RNGs like FlapRNG with the larger state size of LongPeriodRNG, in the hopes of
 * improving Flap's period without seriously reducing speed. It sorta works, since {@link #nextInt()} is faster than
 * {@link LongPeriodRNG#nextLong()} by a fair amount, but only "sorta" because methods like {@link #next(int)} slow
 * down when they are called by classes like RNG. There's some behavior of the JVM at play here, and it may be different
 * across machines and installations. This has 512 bits of {@link #state} in an int array with 16 elements, plus 32
 * bits of semi-state in the {@link #choice} field (used to decide which of the 16 ints in state to update and query).
 * The period is known to be not-terrible, and must be at least (2 to the 48) but is almost certainly much higher, since
 * testing a variant of this with significantly fewer bits of state (using 4 shorts instead of 16 ints, with the same
 * int for choice) still had a period greater than 2 to the 38, implying the period here may be greater than (2 to the
 * 256), and potentially as high as (2 to the 512), though this last possibility is very unlikely.
