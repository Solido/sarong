/**
 * A modification of Blackman and Vigna's xoroshiro64** generator; uses two 32-bit ints of state like Lathe32RNG
 * but has better equidistribution, and is similar to Starfish32RNG but doesn't use multiplication. Otter is
 * 2-dimensionally equidistributed, so it can return all long values except for one, while Lathe is 1-dimensionally
 * equidistributed so it can return all int values but not all longs. Otter passes at least 4TB of PractRand's
 * statistical tests (tests are ongoing, but it has no anomalies so far). In
 * statistical testing, xoroshiro128+ always fails some binary matrix rank tests, but that uses a pair of 64-bit states,
 * and when the states are reduced to 32-bits, these small-word versions fail other tests as well. Otter uses a
 * simpler variant on xoroshiro64** that reduces some issues with that generator and trades them for better-understood
 * issues. Otter does not change xoroshiro's well-tested state transition, but it doesn't base the output on the sum
 * of the two states (like xoroshiro128+), instead using the first state only for output (exactly like xoroshiro64** and
 * similar to xoshiro256**). Any arithmetic it performs is safe for GWT. Starfish adds an extremely small amount of
 * extra code to xoroshiro, running xoroshiro's state transition as normal, using stateA (or s[0] in the original
 * xoroshiro code) plus 0x41C64E6D (which is used as a multiplier in PractRand's preferred LCG types) as the initial
 * result, then bitwise-rotating that initial result by 28, XORing that with the initial result left-shifted by 6
 * (equivalent to the result times 64) and adding a constant that is close to 2 to the 32 times the golden ratio,
 * specifically {@code 0x9E3779BD}. Although no bits of xoroshiro are truly free of artifacts, some are harder to find
 * issues with (see
 * <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/xoroshiro-fails-truncated.html">this article by PCG-Random's author</a>
 * for more detail). It is unclear if the changes made here would improve the larger-state version, but they probably
 * would help to some extent with at least the binary rank failures. The period is identical to xoroshiro with two
 * 32-bit states, at 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF or 2 to the 64 minus 1. This generator is a little slower than xoroshiro64+ or
 * Lathe, but has better distribution than either; it can be contrasted with {@link Starfish32RNG}, which has the same
 * distribution, state size and period, but can be either slower or faster depending on how multiplication is optimized
 * on the target platform, and with{@link XoshiroAra32RNG}, which is somewhat slower on GWT but is 4-dimensionally
 * equidistributed and has a much larger period (and state size). XoshiroAra also has not passed Practrand without
 * anomalies; many seeds when given to XoshiroAra will produce a fair amount of anomalies, usually not considered severe
 * on their own, though. Starfish has passed PractRand without anomalies, and Otter still might.
 * <br>
 * This avoids an issue in xoroshiro** generators where many multipliers, when applied to the output of a xoroshiro**
 * generator, will cause the modified output to rapidly fail binary matrix rank tests. It has its own issue where
 * subtracting {@code 0x9E3779BD} or a number with a low Hamming distance from {@code 0x9E3779BD} from every output will
 * cause similar binary matrix rank failures. It should be clear that this is not a cryptographic generator, but I am
 * not claiming this is a rock-solid or all-purpose generator either; if a hostile user is trying to subvert an Otter
 * generator and can access full outputs, it is a cakewalk to find or create issues. Reversing Otter from its output to
 * one of its inputs is possible, but not as easy as it is for Starfish.
 * <br>
 * The name comes from how the two states float around each other but stay close-by, like sea otters holding hands.
