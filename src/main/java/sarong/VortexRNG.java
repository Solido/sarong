/**
 * A 64-bit generator based on {@link ThrustAltRNG} but with 2 to the 64 possible streams instead of 1 stream.
 * Its period is 2 to the 64, but you can change the stream after some large amount of generated numbers if you want to
 * effectively extend the period. It is currently slightly slower than LightRNG, a generator that at least in theory
 * supports 2 to the 63 switchable streams, but its SplitMix64 algorithm in practice requires disallowing many of
 * those streams. It is unclear how many streams of Vortex may be unsuitable, though because the stream variable changes
 * in-step with the state variable, it seems less likely that a single stream would be problematic for long.
 * <br>
 * This implements SkippingRandomness but not StatefulRandomness, because while you can skip forwards or backwards from
 * any given state in constant time, you would need to set two variables (state and stream) to accurately change the
 * state, while StatefulRandomness only permits returning one 64-bit long for state or setting the state with one long.
