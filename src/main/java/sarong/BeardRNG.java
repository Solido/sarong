/**
 * One of the highest-quality 64-bit-math generators present in this library, complete with a very long period and over
 * 4096 bits of state (4128 if you include a necessary counter). While BeardRNG does not have a fast lookahead or
 * lookbehind and isn't especially fast, those are its most significant flaws. It is related to BirdRNG, but uses more
 * state and 64-bit math to speed up its {@link #nextLong()} operation. BeardRNG currently passes the PractRand suite of
 * RNG quality testing with no failures given 64MB of random ints, on any of the given folding modes. It may be able to
 * pass DIEHARDER, but that wouldn't be much of a surprise because BeardRNG has so much state, and that tends to make
 * passing that test suite easier.
 * <br>
 * The exact period of BeardRNG is unknown at this point. It has 64 longs of state, and updates one long of state by
 * adding a constant value with each generation. Another long, which may be the same one, is also updated by adding a
 * value derived from the state update earlier in the generation. The two longs of state are chosen by using the most
 * significant 6 bits and least significant 6 bits of an int value that has a constant added to it each generation.
 * The maximum period a PRNG can have with 4096 bits of state is 2 to the 4096, but Beard probably has a smaller period
 * than that, possibly as low as 2 to the 127.
