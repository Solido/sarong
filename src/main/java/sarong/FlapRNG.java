/**
 * Like PintRNG (only uses 32-bit int math, good for GWT), but much faster at the expense of quality.
 * This generator is faster than ThunderRNG at generating ints, while also implementing StatefulRandomness. It is slower
 * but not especially slow at generating longs, and takes between 5% and 10% more time than LightRNG to generate longs
 * (it takes about 40% less time than LightRNG to generate ints). Quality is unclear, since this relies on some very
 * particular values for constants and shows various flaws visually when the constants are even slightly off. There are
 * probably better choices for constants out there that we may be able to find, but it doesn't seem easy.
 * It's likely that the period of FlapRNG is only 2 to the 33 (0 seed is allowed), which is much less than many common
 * generators ({@link java.util.Random} has a period of approximately 2 to the 42, for instance). This may be acceptable
 * if you don't expect to generate 8 billion numbers with one FlapRNG.
