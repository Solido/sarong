/**
 * A 32-bit generator that needs no math on 64-bit values to calculate high-quality pseudo-random numbers, and has been
 * adapted to meet the needs of GWT while maintaining compatibility with other JDK platforms. It is a combination of the
 * 32-bit SplitMix algorithm {@link Light32RNG} uses with a 32-bit Marsaglia XorShift generator, adding the XorShift's
 * latest state to an almost-finished SplitMix result before completing the SplitMix steps. It has 2 ints for state,
 * stateA and stateB, where stateA is modified by the XorShift and cannot be given 0, and stateB is modified by SplitMix
 * and can be assigned any int. State A will never be 0, but will be every other int with equal frequency; it repeats
 * every {@code Math.pow(2, 32) - 1} generated numbers. State B goes through every int in a Weyl sequence (adding a
 * large enough odd constant), it is given to SplitMix to alter. The total period is 0xFFFFFFFF00000000
 * (18446744069414584320). Quality is excellent here, and this passes PractRand without failures and only one anomaly
 * (deemed "unusual", not any kind of "suspicious", mid-way through testing) on 32 TB of random values.
 * <br>
 * Although Zig32RNG has a {@link #determine(int, int)} method, calling it is considerably more complex than other
 * RandomnessSources that provide determine() methods. It also doesn't allow skipping through the state, and a moderate
 * amount of the possible values that can be provided with {@link #setState(long)} will be changed before this can use
 * them (there are fewer than 2 to the 64 possible states, but only somewhat).
