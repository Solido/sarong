/**
 * One of the highest-quality 32-bit-math generators present in this library, complete with a very long period and over
 * 2048 bits of state (2080 if you include a necessary counter). While BirdRNG does not have a fast lookahead or
 * lookbehind and isn't especially fast, those are its most significant flaws. While it is slower than FlapRNG and
 * HerdRNG, it should be faster than PintRNG, which is also its closest competitor on quality. While it is similar to
 * LongPeriodRNG in that it has a lot of state, BirdRNG is faster on int generation and not drastically worse on long
 * generation (despite not using long values for state). BirdRNG currently passes the PractRand suite of RNG quality
 * testing with no failures given 64MB of random ints, and generally no more than a few minor anomalies depending on the
 * seeds used. It may be able to pass DIEHARDER, but that wouldn't be much of a surprise because BirdRNG has so much
 * state, and that tends to make passing that test suite easier.
 * <br>
 * There are a lot of quirks in each generator, but it should be mentioned that BirdRNG has an unorthodox state update
 * pattern that may result in a lower period but also ensures its high quality. There are 64 ints of main state stored
 * in an array, as well as 1 int for a counter that is incremented by a very large int with each number generated.
 * The bottom 6 bits of the counter determine the primary part of the state array being updated, which can be any of the
 * 64 ints. The actual value used during the update is chosen from state using an index from the upper 5 bits of
 * counter, which means only 32 of the ints in the main state can be used for this step. A large constant is added to
 * the selected int from state, and this is unsigned-right-shifted by 1. The current counter value is also added into
 * the update value after the shift. Unlike in other versions of BirdRNG and its relative{@link BeardRNG}, only one
 * element of state is changed with each generated int. Even slight tweaks to any part of this generator can completely
 * change the quality. It is unclear if this actually has a lower period than 2 to the 2048, since testing more than 2
 * to the 128 generated numbers empirically would take an incredible amount of time, as well as requiring an impossible
 * amount of storage space, so the proof would need to be algorithmic. Anyone want to try?
