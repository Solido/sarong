/**
 * One of the highest-quality 32-bit-math generators present in this library, complete with a very long period and over
 * 1024 bits of state (1056 if you include a necessary counter). While BirdRNG does not have a fast lookahead or
 * lookbehind and isn't especially fast, those are its most significant flaws. While it is slower than FlapRNG and
 * HerdRNG, it should be faster than PintRNG, which is also its closest competitor on quality. While it is similar to
 * LongPeriodRNG in that it has 1056 bits of state, BirdRNG is much faster on int generation and (strangely) competitive
 * on long generation as well. BirdRNG currently passes the PractRand suite of RNG quality testing with no failures
 * given 64MB of random ints, except on one of PractRand's optional folding modes (32-bit folding with the stdin32
 * argument), where it has 2 failures and 97 anomaly-free tests. It may be able to pass DIEHARDER, but that wouldn't be
 * much of a surprise because BirdRNG has so much state, and that tends to make passing that test suite easier.
 * <br>
 * There are a lot of quirks in each generator, but it should be mentioned that BirdRNG has an unorthodox state update
 * pattern that may result in a lower period but also ensures its high quality. There are 32 ints of main state stored
 * in an array, as well as 1 int for a counter that is incremented by a very large int with each number generated.
 * The bottom 5 bits of the counter determine the primary part of the state array being updated, which can be any of the
 * 32 ints. The actual value used during the update, which is a simple add-and-assign, is determined by the upper 4 bits
 * of counter, which means only 16 of the ints in the main state can be used for this step. The int chosen by the upper
 * bits is incremented by a large value (this is assigned to it as well), then the result unsigned-right-shifted by 1
 * (which reduces the issues of low period on the least significant bit), and this is added to the int of main state
 * chosen by the lower bits. Confused yet? I know I was making this... Even slight tweaks to any part of this generator
 * can completely change the quality. It is unclear if this actually has a lower period than 2 to the 1024, since
 * testing more than 2 to the 128 generated numbers empirically would take an incredible amount of time, as well as
 * requiring an impossible amount of storage space, so the proof would need to be algorithmic. Anyone want to try?
